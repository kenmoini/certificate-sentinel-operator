#### Tested on OpenShift 4.8

> The Certificate Sentinel Operator allows for the scanning and reporting of SSL Certificates within a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.

This Operator provides two Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- **CertificateSentinel** - This provides scanning of a cluster/namespace(es) for PEM-encoded x509 Certificates, generating an overall inventory list, list of expiring certificates, and produces STDOUT and SMTP reports.
- **KeystoreSentinel** - This provides scanning of a cluster/namespace(es) for x509 Certificates in Java Keystores, generating an overall inventory list, list of expiring certificates, and produces STDOUT and SMTP reports.
